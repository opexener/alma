# Note: For testing the lead submission endpoint with file upload,
# you'll need to use a tool like Postman or curl, as HTTP files don't
# support multipart/form-data well.
# 
# Example curl command:
# curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/leads/ \
#   -F "first_name=John" \
#   -F "last_name=Doe" \
#   -F "email=john.doe@example.com" \
#   -F "resume=@/path/to/resume.pdf"
